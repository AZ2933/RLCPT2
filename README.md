# RLC Platinum 2.0 Gamma (Version 2.0.66)

RLC Platinum 2.0 (RLC PT2 or simply PT2 for short) is a highly realistic simulation chip for diesel-electric locomotives in Garry's Mod.

Warning: RLC PT 2.0 is *not* MU-compatible with RLC PT (1).

## To Install:

1. Go into the releases tab on Github, and download the latest release.
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "RLCPT2-master" Folder. You should see three items: a folder named "ptgamma", a folder named "gauges_ptgamma", and readme.md.
4. Extract the two folders directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\ptgamma\...`.
5. If you see the folder "RLCPT2-master" inside the "expression2" folder, __YOU INSTALLED IT WRONG__ and the E2s will not work!

If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the E2 Editor, and click the "Update" button under the list of E2s on the lefthand side of the window.

You will also need GrovestreetGman's Sound packs for RLC PT2 to work correctly. These are the three addons required:
