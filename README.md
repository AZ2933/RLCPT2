### **WARNING**: *RLC Platinum 2.0 Gamma is in development.*

RLC Platinum 2.0 is a *work in progress.* It is not final in any regard, and *may not be stable*. There is, and will continue to be, bugs and issues that will cause problems for any locomotive you make. Updates for PT2 will be frequent and significant to its functioning, and will likely force you to rewrite locomotive configs and potentially rewire dupes. Using PT2 before release will not guarantee you any technical support from its developers or those familiar with it, especially if you use PT2 without asking first. *Use at your own risk.*

# RLC Platinum 2.0 Gamma (Version 2.0.55)

RLC Platinum 2.0 (RLC PT2 or simply PT2 for short) is a highly realistic simulation chip for diesel-electric locomotives in Garry's Mod.

## To Install:

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the screen and select "Download Zip."
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate INTO the "RLCPT2-master" Folder. You should see three items: a folder named "ptgamma", a folder named "gauges_ptgamma", and readme.md.
4. Extract the two folders directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\ptgamma\...`.
5. If you see the folder "RLCPT2-master" inside the "expression2" folder, __YOU INSTALLED IT WRONG__ and the E2s will not work!

You will also need GrovestreetGman's Sound packs for RLC PT2 to work correctly. There are three:
