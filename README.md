### *RLC Platinum 2.0 is finally released!*

What does this mean?

RLC PT 2.0 is now publicly available for use. The version found on here should be stable, however, there is always the chance that some bugs may remain in the code. Future updates are certain, and you will need to update your locomotives as time goes by. That means updating E2s, re-wiring dupes.

Thankfully, certain features within RLC PT 2.0 make it easier for users to update their locomotives, and the new include-based config system should streamline the process. Gone are the days of copy/pasting blocks of code from one PT chip into the next!

# RLC Platinum 2.0 Gamma (Version 2.0.63)

RLC Platinum 2.0 (RLC PT2 or simply PT2 for short) is a highly realistic simulation chip for diesel-electric locomotives in Garry's Mod.

Warning: RLC PT 2.0 is *not* MU-compatible with RLC PT (1).

[Check out the wiki for locomotive data sheets, general info, and PT2-specific tips!](https://github.com/MagnumMacKivler/RLCPT2/wiki)

## To Install:

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the screen and select "Download Zip."
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "RLCPT2-master" Folder. You should see three items: a folder named "ptgamma", a folder named "gauges_ptgamma", and readme.md.
4. Extract the two folders directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\ptgamma\...`.
5. If you see the folder "RLCPT2-master" inside the "expression2" folder, __YOU INSTALLED IT WRONG__ and the E2s will not work!

You will also need GrovestreetGman's Sound packs for RLC PT2 to work correctly. There are three:

Base Sounds: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=240020348

Engine Sounds 1: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1254010890

Engine Sounds 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1254014222

If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the E2 Editor, and click the "Update" button under the list of E2s on the lefthand side of the window.
