RLC Platinum 2.0 (RLC PT2 or simply PT2 for short) is a highly realistic simulation chip for diesel-electric locomotives in Garry's Mod.

## To Install:

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the screen and select "Download Zip."
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate into the "RLCPT2-master" Folder. You should see three items: a folder named "ptgamma", a folder named "gauges_ptgamma", and readme.md.
4. Extract the two folders directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`
