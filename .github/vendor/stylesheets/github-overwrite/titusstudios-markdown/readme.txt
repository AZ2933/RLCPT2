the stylesheet replaces the normal github one with a custom one for cool EFFECTS and stuff. Forked from `https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css` for the default css and added some cool stuff to use in readmes and stuff. This only works for HTML builds locally, or things will render all wacky.
