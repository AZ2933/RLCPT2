# Hello and welcome to TCL's Quillable Horn E2!                                 #
#                                                                               #
# This is based heavily off Magnum's 2-in-1 Horn and Bell E2.                   #
#                                                                               #
# This E2 features Sound Level settings to make horns sound louder, further.    #
# No longer will your PT2 engine sound overpower your awesome horn!             #
#                                                                               #
# The default horn in this E2 is the two-stage widefont K5L from my workshop    #
# addon Trans' Train Sounds. Consider this a plug for that! The Scott's Train   #
# Sounds pack also has some great quillable horns.                              #
#                                                                               #
# IMPORTANT NOTE - The soundLevel function only works on the FC&N Trainbuild    #
# servers, it's a function coded there specifically. You'll have to use other   #
# horn sound systems on other servers.                                          #
#                                                                               #
#   Inputs:                                                                     #
#       Horn - If "1", sounds the horn.                                         #
#       Quill - "1" sounds the horn at half pressure, or sounds another horn    #
#       entirely - whatever you set it to do. Using a single horn? You can      #
#       skip wiring this, or use it for something else.                         #
#                                                                               #
#   Outputs:                                                                    #
#       HQ - Will be "1" if horn is sounding.                                   #
#       QQ - Same as above, but for the quill.                                  #
#                                                                               #
# THIS E2 IS INTENDED FOR ADVANCED TRAINBUILD USERS. If you're looking for a    #
# simple horn and bell sound system, check out the TCL 3 in 1 Quillable Horn    #
# and Bell E2.                                                                  #
