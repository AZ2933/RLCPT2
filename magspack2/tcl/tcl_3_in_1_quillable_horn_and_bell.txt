# Hello and welcome to TCL's 3-in-1 Quillable Horn and Bell E2!                 #
#                                                                               #
# This is based heavily off Magnum's 2-in-1 Horn and Bell E2. I've added a      #
# third sound stream for quillable/two-tone horns, loop/end bell, volume        #
# adjustment for all, and removed the clunky array setup system. Really, this   #
# could just be considered a Soundemitter Replacement Double Triple. (and it    #
# can also be used as one!)                                                     #
#                                                                               #
# The default horn in this E2 is the two-stage sandcast K5L from my workshop    #
# addon Trans' Train Sounds. Consider this a plug for that! The Scott's Train   #
# Sounds pack also has some great quillable horns.                              #
#                                                                               #
#   Inputs:                                                                     #
#       Horn - If "1", sounds the horn.                                         #
#       Quill - "1" sounds the horn at half pressure, or sounds another horn    #
#       entirely - whatever you set it to do. Using a single horn? You can      #
#       skip wiring this, or use it for something else.                         #
#       Bell - "1" sounds the bell. Use of a toggle recommended - most RLC      #
#       stands have a Bell output and BellToggle input.                         #
#                                                                               #
#   Outputs:                                                                    #
#       HQ - Will be "1" if horn is sounding.                                   #
#       QQ - Same as above, but for the quill.                                  #
#       BQ - Same again, but for the bell.                                      #
#                                                                               #
