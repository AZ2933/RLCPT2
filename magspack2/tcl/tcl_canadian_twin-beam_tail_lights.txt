# Hello and welcome to TCL's Canadian Twin-Beam Tail Lights E2!                 #
#                                                                               #
# This E2 simulates the twin-beam "class lights" found on Canadian rail         #
# equipment, such as coaches and cabooses, and even some locomotives.           #
#                                                                               #
# Setup instructions:                                                           #
#   1)  Spawn this E2 somewhere accessible for wiring.                          #
#   2)  Spawn three toggled Wire Buttons and wire them to the On, Left and      #
#       Right inputs.                                                           #
#   3)  Spawn Wire Lights over each lens of your tail lights.                   #
#   4)  Wire your Lights to their respective vector outputs.                    #
#   5)  Use whichever method you like to make the Lights invisible. Make sure   #
#       you test and parent everything when you're done!                        #
#                                                                               #
# Inputs:                                                                       #
#   ON - Turns the E2, and the lights, on.                                      #
#   LEFT - Switches the left side's lights to green.                            #
#   RIGHT - Same, but for the right side.                                       #
#                                                                               #
# Operation:                                                                    #
#   In normal operation, the red lights should be illuminated, as you'd expect. #
#   However, when your train is stopped at a station or clear of the main in a  #
#   siding, the side facing the main track is switched to green. This shows any #
#   train approaching from the rear that your train is, indeed, clear of the    #
#   main track and therefore safe to pass.                                      #
#                                                                               #
