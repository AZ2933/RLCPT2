# This E2 is designed to simulate the Oscitrol oscillating headlight, which     #
# in turn simulates a Gyralite or MARS Light without any moving parts. They     #
# were used by a few railways, including the ATSF on some of their SD40-2       #
# fleet and the Alaska Railroad on the grand majority of their Geeps. Amtrak    #
# also used them extensively in the Northeast.                                  #
#                                                                               #
# Based off the Ditch Lights V5 E2, but changed to a simple toggle on-off       #
# switch rather than limited to a horn-based timer.                             #
#                                                                               #

#   1) Position the E2 light model on your locomotive.                          #
#   2) Place one Wire Light (With NO boxes ticked - important!) over each lens  #
#      of the E2's bezel.                                                       #
#   3) Wire the lights' RGBx[VECTOR] to the two vector outputs of the E2.       #
#   4) Wire a toggled button to the On input.                                   #
#   5) Turn the switch on and test. The two beams of your Oscitrol should flash #
#      alternately.                                                             #
#   6) Make the Wire Lights invisible by whatever means you prefer, parent      #
#      everything to your locomotive and enjoy!                                 #
#                                                                               #
