# This E2 is designed to simulate a simple single-beam flashing red emergency   #
# light, as found on tri-beam Oscitrol setups. Can also be used for FREDS.      #
#                                                                               #
# Based off the Ditch Lights V5 E2, but changed to a simple toggle on-off       #
# switch rather than limited to a horn-based timer.                             #
#                                                                               #
# Setup Instructions:                                                           #
#   1) Position the E2 light model on your locomotive.                          #
#   2) Place one Wire Light (With NO boxes ticked - important!) over the E2's   #
#      lens.                                                                    #
#   3) Wire the light's RGB[VECTOR] to the two vector outputs of the E2.        #
#   4) Wire a toggled button to the On input.                                   #
#   5) Turn the switch on and test. The light should slowly flash at whatever   #
#      rate you set CycleLength to.                                             #
#   6) Make the Wire Light invisible by whatever means you prefer, parent       #
#      everything to your locomotive and enjoy!                                 #
#                                                                               #
