#This file defines what locomotive your RLC PT2 chip will simulate. It is recommended that you save one file for each locomotive you have!
#NOTE: YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY MAKE A NEW FOLDER BEFORE YOU CAN START SAVING E2S INTO IT!!!

#General:

LocomotiveType = "EMD SD40"
    
Horsepower = 3000 #Horsepower Rating; meaningless if there is no prime mover.
Weight = 368000 #Locomotive Weight ON DRIVERS in lb; meaningless if there are no traction motors.
Adhesion = 0.25 #Factor of Adhesion:
#Older Road Locomotives are about 25%
#Switchers and Road Locomotives with High-Adhesion trucks are about 30-32%
#Modern AC Traction locomotives are about 45-50%
Motors = 6 #Number of Traction Motors. Anything else is just absurd, really. Meaningless for Cabcars/Snails.
TopSpeed = 65 #Top Speed, in Miles per Hour, that the locomotive is capable of reaching due to the gearing. If you don't know, put 65.

#Pick a Prime Mover Config File! You can find them in "ptgamma/engines/" !
#include "ptgamma/engines/EMD_V16_645T_Standard"
#What Engine should you pick for your locomotive? Google it.

UnitType = 0
#0 - Locomotive
#1 - Slug (No Prime Mover, has Traction Motors
#2 - Snail (No Traction Motors, has Prime Mover
#3 - Cab Car/Control Cab (No Traction Motors or Prime Mover)

#Transition
#                       Off 1st 2nd 3rd 4th
TransitionGroups = array(3,  3,  2,  1,  1) #The number of motors in series for each transition notch. Note that this number must divide into the number of motors evenly!
TransitionShunts = array(1,  1,  1,  1,  0.5) #The ratio of current going through the field windings for each transition notch, as a fraction of the total load current.
NominalVoltage = 3000
MaxRatedCurrent = 3000

#Dynamic Braking Capabilities:

DynamicsMode = 1
#0 - No Dynamic Brakes
#1 - Proportional Cooling Dynamic Brakes
#2 - Fixed Cooling Dynamic Brakes
FixedDynaThrottle = 50 #Throttle percentage engine goes to for Fixed Cooling mode
BlendedBraking = 0 #Modern Passenger Thing, turns on dynamic brakes when air brake application is made.

#Bonus Features:

TractionMode = 2 #Traction Control Type:
#0 - No Traction Control (Early)
#1 - Automatic Power Reduction (Mid)
#2 - Automatic Power Reduction and Sand (Late)
#3 - Electronic Traction Control (Modern)
DPM = 0 #Dual Prime Movers. Set to 1 if your locomotive has two engines (Like a DDA40X, E unit, or GE 45 Tonner).
HEP = 0 #Head-End Power. Set to 1 if your locomotive is equipped with integrated HEP (like an F40PH or P42DC).
HEP_Subtract = 200 #The Amount of Horsepower to subtract when in HEP mode. GE locomotives use 200, EMD locomotives usually use 700.
HEPTYPE = 0 #0 for 4-8 HEP (Traditional), 1 for 2-4 HEP (For Modern, High-Horsepower Passenger Units like the GE Genesis series).

#Misc:

ExtraBrakeCylinders = 0 #Set to 1 if you have trucks fitted with Double Clasp or Triple Clasp brake cylinders.
HeadlightRGB = vec(255,255,200) #What color do you want your MU Headlights to be, if used.
