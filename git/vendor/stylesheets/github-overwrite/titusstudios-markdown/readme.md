the stylesheet replaces the normal github one with a custom one for cool EFFECTS and stuff. Forked from https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css for the default css and added some cool stuff to use in readmes and stuff. 


This only works for HTML builds locally, or things will render all wacky.

Still in the works to get github to display an HTML file as a readme, which would be AWESOME (github please add). We will have to keep trying ways to get around it for it to work. Hence, this.
